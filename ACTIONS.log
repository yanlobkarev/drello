0)  virtualenv env
    pip install django

1)  django-admin startproject drello 
    cd drello
    mkdir schnapps
    mkdir schnapps/board
    manage.py startapp board schnapps/board

2)  touch db.sqlite3
    touch schnapps/__init__.py
    manage.py migrate
    added 'schnapps.board' to INSTALLED_APPS

3)  pip install django-annoying
    add template to schnapps/templates/board.html
    add view function (with render_to 'board.html') to schnapps/board/views.py
    add routing (to view function) schnapps/board.urls.py
    Now I have Hello board

4)  Now I have to add models scheme.
    Added Status & Task models to schnapps/board/models.py
    manage.py makemigrations
    manage.py migrate
    Added admins to them using simply admin.site.register()
    Now need provide useful plurale names for them using Meta.verbose_name_plural
    Also added __unicode__ model representation so it looks meaningful in admin page
