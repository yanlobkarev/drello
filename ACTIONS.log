0)  virtualenv env
    pip install django

1)  django-admin startproject drello 
    cd drello
    mkdir schnapps
    mkdir schnapps/board
    manage.py startapp board schnapps/board

2)  touch db.sqlite3
    touch schnapps/__init__.py
    manage.py migrate
    added 'schnapps.board' to INSTALLED_APPS

3)  pip install django-annoying
    add template to schnapps/templates/board.html
    add view function (with render_to 'board.html') to schnapps/board/views.py
    add routing (to view function) schnapps/board.urls.py
    Now I have Hello board

4)  Now I have to add models scheme.
    Added Status & Task models to schnapps/board/models.py
    manage.py makemigrations
    manage.py migrate
    Added admins to them using simply admin.site.register()
    Now need provide useful plurale names for them using Meta.verbose_name_plural
    Also added __unicode__ model representation so it looks meaningful in admin page

5)  Needs to add rest api
    pip install djangorestframework, markdown
    Added rest-framework serializers, router (connected it to urls.py via '^api/')
    It was important to use 'ModelViewSet' as a base class for your routed ViewSet
    Linked Status and Task serializers and voila
    api available at 'api/statuses'

6)  Needs to add React shit.
    Add STATICFILES_DIRS to 'settings.py' and static routing in 'urls.py'
    Added Board, Status, Task React components
    Displayed them
    It happens to be very important to provide unique 'key' in props for child components. 

7)  Added ugly nazi styles, used 'display: flex' everywhere.
    Added '+' and 'X' buttons for adding/deleting tasks.
    But before adding Task CRUD API, I need to add tests.
    Used 'rest_framework.test.APIClient' cuz it easy to start with first failing test.
    Adding REST CRUD endpoint for single model was easy as shit:
        By adding again 'rest_framework.viewsets.ModelViewSet' for Task.
    Re-running test: failed with authentication
    Disabled them in each view sets (authentication_classes = permission_classes = [])
    './manage.py test'
    Tests passed!

8)  Gotcha: EVERYWHERE USE '#!/usr/bin/env python' SHEBANG WHEN USES VIRTUALENV. BITCH!
    Added Django channels websockets for broadcasting events.
    (Used following tutorials:
        https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html
        https://blog.heroku.com/in_deep_with_django_channels_the_future_of_real_time_apps_in_django)
    Added Django (post_save, post_delete) signals receivers in 'signals.py' 
    (To enable them had to import 'signals.py' in 'django.BoardConfig.ready()' and \
    specify 'default_app_config' in 'schnapps.board.__init__.py')
    Then, I connected signal receivers to channels Group.
    Subscribed React 'Status' component to reply_channels (websocket) updates.
    And all 'Task' creations/deletions are synchronously displayed in separate browser tabs.

9)  Now I need 'Task' title editing.
